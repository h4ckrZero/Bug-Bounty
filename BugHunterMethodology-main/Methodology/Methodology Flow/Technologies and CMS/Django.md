- XSS can be occurred in `<a>` and `<form>` or `<iframe>` tags (when the input is reflected there)
- Look for `IDOR`, `SSTI` (old version) and logic based vulnerabilities
- Fuzz to discover endpoint not files or directories

    - Change the host header to something else
    - Sending Request to the 404 page and search for
